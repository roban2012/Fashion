Snowdon this 21st century Mole does not want to master the secrets through their exchange of money and he sees himself as an idealist, beliefs personal sovereignty, away from the tyranny of the people of China and the Russian spies will not entice him.  <br><br>

Snowdon is guided hacker thinking, a kind of network of political philosophy, a message board set up in the 1980s, in the 1990s, the development of the chat room, and in the similar Reddit, 4chan this contemporary online communities gradually mature way of thinking .  <br><br>

Snowden believes that freedom of information should prevail above all, privacy is sacred, and he has the responsibility to protect these two points.  <br><br>

'These projects and public policies need to decide right and wrong.' The 29-year-old former U.S. National Security Agency contractor said. Snowdon June 6 admitted that he stole a large number of confidential documents, which is the most significant in American history theft of highly confidential documents he leaked to the media revealed a document will be organized into American phone records for counterterrorism and counterintelligence investigations huge database used items. another called 'Prism' items are able to reach the NSB to Google, Facebook, Microsoft and other major Internet service providers record and the court's permission to collect foreign intelligence suspects. secret project that has been running for seven years.  <br><br>

'I am no different from other people,' Snowden said. 'I'm just an ordinary office workers,' he said in an interview << >> The Guardian said.   Guardian and Washington Post: The earliest reported Prism door project.  <br><br>

However, in order for the government contractor Booz Allen analysis of Snowdon is not an ordinary person in the military and intelligence agencies to work more than 140 million Americans now have the most advanced security permits. Most people may not have so much anti-bone - via encrypted e-mail to contact reporters and activists to disclosure of government secrets. few people are willing to give up the house, $ 122,000 annual salary of the job, girlfriend or freedom to get exposure before and after the two-term president of the Congress and approved by the monitoring project, and These projects are also highly regulated in the Federal Court under.  <br><br>

Snowdon is different, this difference is changing everything.  <br><br>

A brave new world  <br><br>

Construction of the U.S. national security infrastructure designed to protect the United States from enemies and spies damage. Snowdon 20 generations so that native American technology house but does not agree with this view, they have set their own world how it should operate utopian idea, as Vietnam-era anti-war protesters that human nature is peace, not war, a new generation of fans that extreme techniques, information transparency and privacy is the foundation of a free society, secrets and surveillance is the door leading to tyranny These Baoliao that in face of tyranny, rebellion is noble.  <br><br>

Famous hacker, REDDIT early employee Allen - Schwarz in 2008 published a private document called the Declaration said: 'Justice is not to comply with unjust laws, we need public information, regardless of where they are stored, and then copy, and to share information with the world. '  <br><br>

Snowdon fled to Hong Kong after a local hotel room to accept video interview explained his motives, even in the CIA said that he might have been assassinated or kidnapped by the Chinese mafia, he performed very proud and calm He will own exposure monitoring project is defined as 'jailer tyranny,' and the current regulatory measures taken by the consequences of the absence of a warning.  <br><br>

He hoped that triggered a public debate in order to make the information public technology. Snowden said of his stole and published the document, said: 'This is the truth, which is taking place in reality you should decide whether we need to do so. '  <br><br>

Three years ago, in Iraq 22 years old Army intelligence analyst Manning leaked after a large number of military and diplomatic secrets gives almost the same self-defense grounds. WikiLeaks website to provide tens of thousands of copies of confidential documents of the United States in a letter Manning a hacker friend's letter said: 'I want people to see the truth, because in the case of information not obtained, the public will not be able to make the right decision.'  <br><br>

And Snowdon, like Manning, said he is most worried about is not their behavior changed the world, but can not change the world.  <br><br>

These two young men are in the 9-11 terrorist attacks have taken stringent security measures brought up during their era filled with networking, chat rooms and virtual communities, and in these communities, the new anti-authority, Freedom of Information ideology are strengthening their identity at least part of the Liberals. Manning used the word to describe themselves, Snowdon is to Ron - Paul's presidential campaign donation camp. they do not think their behavior is betrayal countries. Manning wrote before his arrest: 'Information should be free, it belongs to the public.' He said he was not sure that he is a hacker, cracker, hacker activists, leaks, or others in what capacity.  <br><br>

'We are a legion.'  <br><br>

Manning's statement is radical because it directly undermines the rule of law, and the rule of law should be acknowledged that the two things. 'When you subvert the government authority, which is a fundamental danger to democracy thing,' Snowdon this talk about their actions, while the U.S. government officials, the general view is that Snowden impulse is very wrong, and may constitute a substantial hazard, 'I am very sure that this young people doing would endanger the lives of some people, 'Republican Senator from Georgia, the Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Saxby - money Brisbane said. Whether Obama or the Democratic and Republican officials are not too concerned about.' Prism 'Monitoring the legality or validity of the project, but are keen to incorporate Snowdon arrest and brought to trial according to TIME Magazine poll, 53 percent of the American public should have been considered Snowdon to the prosecution, while 28% of respondents think we can let him go.  <br><br>

Snowdon and Manning but people of similar age, for their support was significantly higher ,18-34-year-old respondents 43% think Snowdon should be prosecuted. Such hacker spirit world is now being grow, in which the driving force is a lot of hackers. them through online protests and information theft, more and more frequently disrupt various types of institutional power. 'This is something most people feel encouraged, through online education for young people are radicalized, they get their value from the Internet, 'WikiLeaks founder Julian - Assange in April this year with Google CEO Eric - Schmidt said when talking.' This is a bunch of apolitical technology enthusiasts endured political education, which is highly unusual. '  <br><br>

A similar story appeared in the newspaper almost every day and the courts. Then fled with Snowdon with data similar to Hong Kong, when on May 28, a man named Jeremy - Hammond's 28-year-old hacker in New York pleaded, from an intelligence agency Stratfor stolen emails and credit card information. Hammond on their own and the 'Anonymous' hacker organizations did not express remorse law violations. 'I do so because I believe that people have the right to know the government and businesses are doing behind the scenes, 'pleaded guilty, he wrote on a Web site.' I think I did the right thing. '  <br><br>

In recent years, 'Anonymous' hacker organizations have 'Master' such a big company and the American Film Institute is a big organization carried out the attack on the grounds that they lack the public. They organized for the San Francisco Bay Area rail transport system protests because the authorities closed the cellular communications services, they waged against the world 'scientific teaching' rally against the extreme secrecy of religious organizations in 2011, claiming to be 'anonymous' organization hackers steal the Sony PlayStation 77 million accounts of personal information that led to this game a month shutdown of the network, while this behavior is for the Sony console firmware in its mandatory installation of certain features.  <br><br>

Also some hackers took aim at the academic and legal institutions. Committed suicide in January of this year, 26-year-old computer genius Swartz had illegally entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's academic computer, download and published millions of copies of computer systems from the United States Court file, read the documentation to protest fee system, he subsequently tried to download a lot of academic material is protected by copyright arrested. 'Those who will not be kept out nothing.' He had this message for his public acts of defense.  <br><br>

These 'release archives' protests, in accordance with U.S. law, it is a crime, but in most cases, these are not legally punish offenses against when they conduct 'denial of service' attack and cause network congestion, web server downtime when they actually simulate a protest action, but such action is protected by the First Amendment. Still others adopted a practice of the early Internet age. founder of social networking site Facebook Mark - Zuckerberg Harvard University had sneaked into the network database, access to student's identity information and create a Facebook predecessor Facemash. Apple founder Steve - Steve Jobs, a young man who sold a friend - Wozniak making a box to deceive communications carriers to make free long distance calls. Microsoft founder Bill - Gates has sneaked into an early computer company accounts in order to obtain free access permissions.  <br><br>

The early 1990s, the goal of hacking began to expand, private information such as ensuring network security. A Ming Jiaofei children - Zimmerman hackers have developed a program called PGP data encryption, and this program is to software technology as confidential and protected by U.S. law prohibits the export, so, Zimmerman at MIT published a book discloses the source code of this program, as printed matter exports are protected by the First Amendment protection. similar to the 'loophole' approach to promote the development of the network hacker movement, but also motivated the WikiLeaks organization. Nowadays, this challenging spirit still dominates the Internet, inspired like Snowdon, Manning and Swartz such people. 'This generation of young people has always been taught that those who seem extremely reasonable behavior is often criminal, 'says Harvard law professor Lawrence Swartz former mentor - Lessing says.  <br><br>

Northwestern University philosophy professor Peter - Lude Luo wrote many articles about Internet culture, he talked about the recent hacking, there are two completely different ideas together. 'Hacker spirit is mostly liberal, but by anti-authoritarian political enthusiasm drive, then a collision spread like wildfire. '  <br><br>

'We are a legion,' This is the hacker group 'Anonymous,' the famous slogan. 'We will never forgive, we will never forget, we believe.' Now, the government need to find ways how to deal with it.  <br><br>

Dawn of the era of whistleblowers  <br><br>

After Snowden leaks, including Reddit, 4chan and other online photo site, including the 86 community organizations jointly signed a petition alone, asked the U.S. Congress to the NSA surveillance program as unconstitutional, while the White House, Obama requested a pardon petition website Snowden's petition also collect the 60,000 people within three days of signing George - Orwell's classic novel   1984   so sales surge. often progressive liberal candidate to raise funds to change campaign committee (The Progressive Change Campaign Committee) was set up a legal defense Snowdon fund Hollywood director Oliver - Stone, actress Maggie - Gyllenhaal and Peter - Sarsgaard and several liberal reporters, etc. are set up a called 'I am Bradley - Manning,' the social media campaign, claiming that Manning came to light just one person, and should be protected from prosecution.  <br><br>

Even the atmosphere of freedom that has always been known for the Internet giant, but also unwilling people at Snowdon named pointed out Google, Facebook and Microsoft are partners prism plan shortly after, these companies are required to disclose to the court the Justice Department to allow more Previously secret details about cooperation. reasons: they do not want smashed his own freedom to establish long experiment, minimize regulation of the Internet's signature. 'Google is nothing off to hide,' Google chief legal counsel David - Drummond in an open letter said.  <br><br>

Compared with these technology companies, the American public's attitude is somewhat subtle.   Time magazine poll showed that only 43% of citizens believe that the Government should 'cut a threat to personal privacy projects,' 20% of respondents said Even if a violation of privacy, the government should continue these programs for items disclosed Snowdon agree that the American public's view is also divided into two, 48% agree, 44% held the opposite attitude.  <br><br>

Government, as an attempt to put Snowdon Cold War spy harming national interests, even though I repeatedly said he is very Snowdon patriotic Ministry of Justice has begun investigating leaked confidential information, which is the standard prelude for alleged espionage Although there may be charges filed from a very long time, but the prosecution is likely to be extradited to the United States tries to Snowdon trial and sentenced to life imprisonment.  <br><br>

U.S. Army Counterintelligence Center in 2008 in a document might be able to a good summary of the federal government for this new online political radicalism response. Document leaked by hackers and posted to the Web. 'Sites such as WikiLeaks has become shield insiders, leakers, whistleblowers identity and privacy as an important base. 'military solution proposed is to find, exposure and punish these people,' to destroy this center and to deter others considering similar initiatives. '  <br><br>

The government has begun to read too much into this guiding ideology. Manning was arrested three years ago, the prison environment is very poor, including 23 hours a day is limited to his cell, etc. This also raises the concern of Amnesty International. Before the UN Human Rights investigators, former U.S. State Department spokesman Philip - Crowley described this practice as 'ridiculous, stupid and counterproductive.' Crowley to resign for the remarks, but shortly after a federal judge ruled that Manning's sentence will be reduced by 112 days, in order to compensate for their pre-trial suffered harsh treatment.  <br><br>

Manning has 10 pleaded guilty to misuse of confidential information, the maximum amount of 20 years in prison, he was accepted at Fort Meade, Maryland, military tribunals, there is also the headquarters of the NSA bases. Manning also by assisting the enemy and violations Espionage Act charges, there may be sentenced to life imprisonment. (Editor's note: the 30th U.S. court has ruled that Manning espionage, theft, and a number of other offenses, but to assist the enemy not guilty, he could face 136 years in prison. ) 'I imagined that this information should be public,' he said in his defense of the word.  <br><br>

Manning leak after the incident, the intelligence community, the State Department and the military to try to improve procedures to ensure that similar incidents do not recur. New measures will detect a lot of downloading classified information practices, monitoring military institutions, improving distinction between confidential information. Obviously, there are many to be done. a White House official described the threat by saying: 'There is a belief that all of the information disclosed in the public interest.' the official stressed that as Snowdon event, the future access to confidential files will be changed, may further restrict information sharing.  <br><br>

Senator Lindsey - Graham said: 'I think there is a number of young people who have never experienced war, most liberals think government is the problem.' Graham helped draft the management NSA surveillance program law, he said he hoped the intelligence community to make more internal efforts, leakers public appearances before the monitor to them, and severely punished for Snowdon, Graham said: 'We must seize him, and I do not care that we need to do What we want this guy to justice, a warning to others. 'some other dynamic monitoring intelligence community believes that this matter will not be so simple. Snowdon not government officials, but private sector employment personnel .9 -11, the U.S. intelligence system employs thousands of private companies, while the punishment for Manning does not prevent Snowdon, even for the same activists who paved the road to the future fame and martyrdom Senator money Bristol said: 'The intelligence community to come countermeasures can be challenging, and perhaps fundamentally the game.'  <br><br>

Meanwhile, as the Internet challenges young people to grow in culture grew up Snowdon a principled class martyrs seize the public imagination, there may be more leaks. Professor at McGill University in Canada, was writing about the general 'Anonymous' hackers books Gabriella - Coleman said: 'These emotions are usually strongly resisted galvanize political mobilization, deepen agree, I think we're way into the dawn.'  <br><br>

求是：否定太平天国、义和团等是历史虚无主义<br><br>

摘要：历史虚无主义的矛头多指向中国共产党领导的中国革命和社会主义道路，又常以否定中国近代革命为切入点，否定中国人民的反侵略斗争，否定太平天国、义和团、辛亥革命等，说什么太平天国革命“绝无进步的历史意义可言”，辛亥革命“给社会造成的破坏大于建设”。<br><br>

　　近年来，历史虚无主义打着“学术反思”的旗号，借“还原历史”、“重写历史”之名，否定党史、歪曲国史，这种历史观无视历史现象的内在联系和因果关系，无视历史规律，不仅对我国的历史学研究造成危害，而且通过大众传媒对广大干部群众思想造成干扰，在“举什么旗、走什么路、朝着什么目标前进”等重大问题上造成困惑，对此，我们必须旗帜鲜明地加以反对。<br><br>

　　一<br><br>

　　历史虚无主义的矛头多指向中国共产党领导的中国革命和社会主义道路，又常以否定中国近代革命为切入点，否定中国人民的反侵略斗争，否定太平天国、义和团、辛亥革命等，说什么太平天国革命“绝无进步的历史意义可言”，辛亥革命“给社会造成的破坏大于建设”；“自辛亥革命以后，就是不断革命：‘二次革命’、‘护国护法’、‘大革命’……革命在中国不是什么好事情”，它造成“社会动荡，经济停滞”，是脱离实际的“激进主义”，“阻碍了社会发展”等等。事实上，1840年以来，中国人民为争取民族独立和人民解放而进行的革命，是当时的世情和国情使然。当工业革命、商品经济、资产阶级民主革命推动世界发生极为深刻的历史性变化时，当西方国家迅速崛起，列强纷纷加入瓜分世界行列时，清王朝为保统治阶级利益拒绝任何制度性改良和改革，导致社会矛盾日益尖锐，经济社会发展趋于停滞，中国国力迅速衰退。英法联军、八国联军长驱直入，到处烧杀抢掠，清政府毫无还手之力，只能甘于丧权辱国，任人宰割。国将不国的亡国奴命运摆在每一个中国人面前，中国人民不起来革命推翻腐朽的封建专制，还等什么？毛泽东同志在高度评价辛亥革命的历史意义时说：孙中山及其一派人领导的辛亥革命，是人类历史上资产阶级民主革命中的一次。他公开号召实行资产阶级民主革命，推翻了清朝的统治，结束了中国两千多年的封建帝制，建立了中华民国和临时革命政府，并制定了一个《临时约法》。辛亥革命以后，谁要再想做皇帝，就做不成了，所以我们说它有伟大的历史意义。(见《毛泽东文集》第6卷第345―346页，人民出版社1999年版)<br><br>

　　当中华民族在帝国主义、封建主义和官僚买办资本主义掠夺、凌辱、重压之下，现代化是无从谈起的。毛泽东同志说：“没有独立、自由、民主和统一，不可能建设真正大规模的工业。没有工业，便没有巩固的国防，便没有人民的福利，便没有国家的富强。”(《毛泽东选集》第2版第3卷第1080页)中国共产党领导的独立、自由、解放的新民主主义革命和社会主义革命的历史充分证明：革命是历史的火车头，是现代化的助推器。没有中国共产党领导的人民革命的胜利，就不可能有中国社会主义现代化。中国共产党自1921年成立以来，领导中国人民完成和推进了三件大事：一是完成了新民主主义革命，实现了民族独立和人民解放，建立了人民当家作主的中华人民共和国。二是创造性地实现了从新民主主义到社会主义的转变，完成了社会主义革命，确立了社会主义基本制度。三是进行了改革开放新的革命，开创、坚持和发展了中国特色社会主义。这三件大事，不可逆转地改变了中国人民和中华民族的前途命运，不可逆转地开启并推进了中国现代化。<br><br>

　　历史虚无主义在否定中国革命的同时，还极力否定中华人民共和国史，否定中国选择社会主义道路，说这是“误入历史的歧途”。有的甚至说什么“如果当时中国随便搭上哪一条顺风船，比如追随美国，中国的处境会比现在强盛得多”。这些人无视以慈禧太后为代表的清朝政府，“量中华之物力，结与国之欢心”，被时人讥为“洋人的朝廷”，结果怎样呢？美国没让搭“顺风船”，中国也没成为“日本”，倒沦为半殖民地半封建社会。中国近现代的世情和国情证明，中国要实现国家富强、民族振兴、人民幸福，只能走社会主义道路，不能走资本主义道路，这是历史的必然，人民的选择。从新中国发展的历史成就看，1949年新中国成立时，旧中国留下的经济“烂摊子”只有16万吨钢，充斥市场的是形形色色西方“洋”货。60多年后，全国钢产量超过5亿吨，各种新兴工业从无到有、从小到大，形成了独立的比较完整的工业体系和国民经济体系，经济总量跃升为世界第二；尖端科学技术突飞猛进，“中国制造”除“两弹一星”之外，载人航天、探月工程、载人深潜、超级计算机、北斗导航系统等工程均有重大突破。新中国成立之初，城乡居民生活普遍贫困，多数人处于衣不蔽体、食不果腹的境地。60多年后，实现了经温饱到小康的历史性跨越，人均GDP从1949年的35美元增至2011年的5400多美元。新中国走社会主义道路，在短短60多年时间里，完成了资本主义国家上百年的现代化历程，辉煌成就，举世公认。这样的事实是虚无不了的历史，这样的历史是抹杀不了的事实。<br><br>

　　二<br><br>

　　历史虚无主义虚无历史，理论并不高深，方法也不新鲜，依旧是老调重弹、故伎重演，用历史唯心主义和形而上学颠倒历史，混淆黑白。虚者，模糊、歪曲也；无者，抹杀、消除也。历史虚无主义不辨历史的现象与本质、部分与整体、支流与主流、成功与失误、过程与规律。他们“研究”历史，不是在全面、系统占有翔实史料的基础上，把握历史事实的总和阐述内在联系，梳理历史发展过程，总结历史经验，揭示历史规律，而是随意剪裁和拼凑史实，牵强附会，以点代面，以偏概全，指鹿为马，糟蹋历史。譬如，新中国的社会主义建设，以改革开放为界，可划分为两个“相互联系又有重大区别的时期”，辩证统一于党领导人民对社会主义建设的实践探索。诚然，中国特色社会主义是在改革开放后开创的，但充分利用了改革开放前社会主义建设积累的宝贵经验、理论准备和物质基础。历史虚无主义却把二者割裂开来、对立起来，怀疑和反对改革开放的时候，就用改革开放前的历史否定改革开放后的历史；怀疑和反对四项基本原则的时候，就用改革开放后的历史否定改革开放前的历史。<br><br>
灭人之国，必先去其史<br><br>
　　历史虚无主义虽然是一种非主流思潮，但其产生的负能量危害极大。任其蔓延，就会涣散和弱化主流意识形态，使人潜移默化地容忍和接受隐藏在这种思潮背后去史灭国、改旗易帜的图谋。清代思想家龚自珍，在《古史钩沉论二》中为后人写下一段弥足珍贵的文字，至今读来仍令人振聋发聩，其中心论点就是“灭人之国，必先去其史”。这条途径隐晦而阴险，要害是歪曲和颠倒历史，搞乱人们思想，为江山易主、改朝换代制造舆论。苏联亡党亡国就是明证。<br><br>

　　苏共亡党、苏联解体的原因固然很多，但意识形态领域大刮历史虚无主义之风，不能不说是一个重要原因。苏联在20世纪50年代以后，历史虚无主义就开始在史学界、理论界、思想界抬头，并逐渐渗透到政治领域，出现了上有赫鲁晓夫的“秘密报告”、戈尔巴乔夫的“新思维”和叶利钦的退出苏共演说，下有大批崇拜“人道的民主的社会主义”的政论家、作家、教授等这样一种局面。到1987年，在全国形成了一场反思历史、重评历史的运动。1987年苏联就有人公开撰文反对苏联中小学的历史教材，1988年苏联教育主管部门要求全部销毁中小学历史教材。1988年后，历史虚无主义进一步泛滥，他们与形形色色的境内外反共反社会主义分子一道，大肆攻击革命领袖、抹黑苏共历史。他们追随赫鲁晓夫“秘密报告”的论调，从批判斯大林入手，进而攻击诽谤列宁和斯大林开创的十月社会主义革命道路，诬蔑十月革命使俄国离开了“人类文明的正道”，诋毁苏联走社会主义道路是“历史的迷误”，全面否定苏联社会主义建设成就，促使苏共党员和苏联人民“迷途知返”，结果导致了全民族的精神支柱坍塌，自我否定成为主流，建党80多年执政70多年的苏联共产党最终退出历史舞台，世界第二大强国很快分崩离析。前车之覆，后车之鉴。苏联的惨痛教训警示我们：在当今世界正在发生深刻复杂变化的形势下，境内外反华势力从未放松西化、分化社会主义国家的政治图谋，作为这种图谋内应的历史虚无主义，借助于毁灭民族的历史记忆，动摇共同奋斗的思想基础，从而达到从根本上否定共产党的历史地位、改变社会主义发展方向，分裂、葬送社会主义国家的目的。我们必须认清历史虚无主义的理论错误和政治危害，时刻警惕历史虚无主义的沉渣泛起，坚决抵制和消除历史虚无主义影响。<br><br>

　　三<br><br>

　　坚决排除历史虚无主义在意识形态领域的干扰，要在根本上下功夫。<br><br>

　　大力弘扬唯物史观，它是识别和应对历史虚无主义最锐利的思想武器。列宁强调，唯物史观是“唯一科学的历史观”。(《列宁选集》第2版第1卷第10页)实践反复证明：迄今为止，还不曾发现有哪一种历史观能同它分庭抗礼，更谈不上取而代之。唯物史观的这种特殊地位和特殊作用，不是某个人或某个集体自封的，而是屡经理论交锋、屡经实践检验胜出的。唯物史观是人们正确对待历史的根本指针，这个指针涵盖的立场观点方法是：站在党和人民的立场，用辩证的、历史的、实践的观点来解读与运用历史，坚持党性原则与科学精神的统一，处理好政治与学术、历史与现实的关系，维护正确结论，反对错误倾向。哲学社会科学工作者在这方面要发挥理论优势，不断为推进中国特色社会主义历史进程提供理论支撑与历史智慧。<br><br>

　　坚定党的历史自信，特别是要对党领导人民革命、建设和改革的历史，对中国人民在探索和奋斗中选择中国共产党，选择马克思主义，选择社会主义道路，选择改革开放的历史必然性坚信不移。坚定党的历史自信，一个重要方面就是坚定走中国特色社会主义道路。道路是决定中国命运的问题，正如习近平同志所指出的：中国特色社会主义这条道路来之不易，它是在改革开放30多年的伟大实践中走出来的，是在中华人民共和国成立60多年的持续探索中走出来的，是在对近代以来170多年中华民族发展历程的深刻总结中走出来的，是在对中华民族5000多年悠久文明的传承中走出来的，具有深厚的历史渊源和广泛的现实基础。只有坚持历史自信，才能坚持道路自信，才能在深入思考的历史进程中更好地走向未来。<br><br>

　　学史用史，以史为鉴，不断从历史中吸取营养和智慧。“欲知大道，必先为史。”中国共产党在领导革命、建设和改革的征程中，始终注意引导全党特别是各级领导干部学史用史。党的十八大以来，以习近平同志为总书记的党中央弘扬这个优良传统，把学史用史提到全局高度。2013年上半年，他在纪念中共中央党校建校80周年、主持中央政治局第7次集体学习、中央军委召开党的群众路线教育实践活动专题民主生活会等不同场合的讲话中都强调：历史是最好的教科书。要认真学习党史、国史和军史。这门功课不仅必修，而且必须修好。只有这样，才能把中国特色社会主义伟大事业不断推向前进。<br><br>

遗诏”能证明雍正继位的合法性吗？<br><br>
Hack way, Now you can see (Now you see me)<br><br>


作者： 侯杨方   2013-09-20 <br><br>


遗诏不止一份，也非首次公开<br><br>

近来，雍正皇帝是否篡位的问题，又一次成了公众与媒体的热点，起因是辽宁省档案馆“首度”展出了用汉、满、蒙三种文字书写的“康熙遗诏”：“雍亲王皇四子胤G，人品贵重，深肖朕躬，必能克承大统，着继朕登基，继皇帝位”，有媒体据此给出了答案：“没篡位。”<br><br>

首先要纠正的是，这件康熙皇帝遗诏并非“首度”公开，它也远不止一份，在北京的中国第一历史档案馆起码就收藏有两份，并且在2005年、2010年公开展出过，当时众多媒体也同样炒作过一番，并以此证明雍正继位合法；而更早在2002年6月，台湾中央研究院历史语言研究所的文物陈列馆就展出过这件遗诏，并一直常年展出，我也曾得以亲见。这件遗诏曾于2009年借展于台北故宫，当时大陆、台湾众多媒体也据此称雍正皇帝得以“平反”。十多年来，围绕康熙皇帝遗诏的炒作已经起码有三四次了，每次的论点、论证方式均大同小异，即以此遗诏证明雍正皇帝继位是合法的。<br><br>

遗诏不能证明雍正是否篡位<br><br>

现存海峡两岸的康熙遗诏有多个复本，它们都并非康熙皇帝临终前亲自手书，也不等同于现代法律意义上的遗嘱，只是他去世后继任皇帝用以昭告天下、宣示继位合法性的公告，这件汉文本长达一千余字的遗诏，主要内容来源于康熙五十六年（1717年）康熙皇帝病重时公布的已经准备十年的上谕，只是加上了最关键的由谁继位的内容。<br><br>

同样，以此件遗诏中没有“十四子”被篡改“于四子”来当作雍正皇帝合法继位的证据也非常可笑。这一极其拙劣的传说，是雍正皇帝的政敌――康熙皇帝的皇八子、九子府中被流放的太监一路散播的，不仅无视在正式政府公文中“於”、“于”并不通用，清朝皇子一定要称“皇某子”，而且遗诏还有满、蒙文本，且正本是满文本。它只能忽悠对清宫制度几乎一无所知的人，但这个传说一直被众多媒体不厌其烦、煞有介事地反复津津乐道。<br><br>

这件遗诏无法证明雍正皇帝篡位与否，因为无论是否篡位，在继位后命人撰写这种遗诏都是轻而易举的；而且无论篡位与否，写这种官样的遗诏，绝不会犯以“于”代“於”的低级文字错误。因此，用这件遗诏以及其中有无文字篡改来证明继位的合法与否，完全是缘木求鱼。但这种思维即使某位宋史权威也有过，他曾断言，宋太祖没有遗诏是宋太宗篡位的重要证据，而事实上，宋太祖的遗诏明明保留在《宋大诏令集》与《宋会要辑稿》中，但这与雍正皇帝继位一样，有无遗诏并非继位合法与否的证据，因此这种论证是没有意义的。<br><br>

康熙为何不再立太子<br><br>

既然遗诏不能证明篡位与否，那么雍正皇帝到底是否篡位？<br><br>

康熙皇帝早在21岁时就模仿汉制，改变了传统的八旗王公推举制，立当时尚在襁褓的嫡长子胤i为皇太子，对他倾注了极大的热情与精力培养；在三次亲征时，皇太子即留守京城处理日常政务。胤i的皇太子一当就是三十多年，而康熙皇帝也步入晚年，一些大臣展望未来，形成了以皇太子为中心的利益集团，父子间的关系越发紧张，直至康熙四十七年（1708年）太子出现了谋逆行动而被废。<br><br>

皇太子位一空，就招致康熙皇帝众多成年儿子们的觊觎，引发旷日持久的立储之争，为了平息儿子们的激烈争斗，康熙皇帝甚至一度复立太子，但父子间的互信已经完全丧失，仅一年后太子再次被废，此时康熙皇帝对太子彻底死心：“后若有奏请皇太子已经改过从善，应当释放者，朕即诛之。”经过两次废太子的风波，康熙皇帝鉴于诸皇子“年俱长成，已经分封，其所属人员，未有不各庇护其主者”，如果另立太子，必然又会导致争斗，甚至威胁到他本人的安全，因此在余下的十多年中，他不再立太子。<br><br>

但毕竟要选择一位继承人，自第一次废太子后，康熙皇帝的身体大不如前，这个问题变得非常紧迫，大臣为此也非常焦急，担心他突然去世，因此不断催促他早立太子。<br><br>

康熙五十六年十一月，他又一次病倒，召集群臣公布了他自废太子后就准备好遗嘱，实质是对他一生的总结。他向群臣表明“立储大事，朕岂忘耶”；“此谕已备十年，若有遗诏，无非此言。披肝露胆，罄尽五内，朕言不再”。但他始终不明确心目中的继承人，只透露：“朕万年后，必择一坚固可托之人，与尔等作主，令尔等永享太平。”<br><br>

原因可能有二：一是他自己当时也不知道继承人是谁，还需要慢慢观察；二是即使他知道也不会公布，因为这会让继承人成为矛盾的焦点，可能会成为废太子第二，因此他只恳求大臣们念他是五十余年的太平天子，“扯＿谭锤粗苦衷”，能让他平安度过晚年。<br><br>

康熙选择了秘密立储<br><br>

康熙皇帝仿效汉族的太子制度彻底失败，从深层次讲，是汉族制度与满洲旧制之间的冲突导致的。<br><br>

清朝开始没有预立皇位继承人的习惯，而是在皇帝去世后由王公贵族推选，择贤而立，有竞争性，并且按照传统，皇家子弟均参与军国大事，这个传统并非预立太子就能一下废除的，因此太子成为众矢之的，被兄弟们拉下马也不奇怪。<br><br>

经过两次废太子的挫折，一向乾纲独断的康熙皇帝既不愿意恢复满洲的传统，将立储大事交给王公贵族决定，也不可能再次仿效汉制立太子，因此他别无选择，只好选择了秘密立储，即在自己去世前才会宣布继承人选。<br><br>

毫无疑问，选择一名合格的继承人是康熙皇帝晚年考虑的头等大事，当时最有可能继承皇位的首先是皇子中仅有的三位亲王，即皇三子诚亲王胤祉、皇四子雍亲王胤G、皇五子恒亲王胤祺，以及一位后起之秀――皇十四子胤_。胤_于康熙五十七年被任命为抚远大将军，以“大将军、王”的名义出征青海，成为一颗上升的政治明星，并成为皇八子党的新希望。<br><br>

雍亲王之子弘历，深得康熙喜爱<br><br>

康熙六十一年三月丁酉，公历1722年4月27日，“皇四子和硕雍亲王胤G恭请上幸王园进宴”，《清实录》对这一天的记载只有这么短短的一句话，但这是决定历史的一天，“王园”即是由康熙皇帝赐名的圆明园。这一天康熙皇帝应儿子胤G的邀请赴宴，在圆明园中的牡丹台第一次遇见了胤G的儿子弘历。年近古稀的祖父一见年方10岁的孙子，非常喜爱，竟于13天后第二次赴圆明园，并将弘历带往宫中亲自教育、抚养。康熙皇帝有一百多个孙子，此前只有废太子的嫡长子弘皙有过这样的经历。<br><br>

65年后，乾隆皇帝弘历深情回忆当年他在祖父面前背诵《爱莲说》，并解释文义，深得祖父喜爱；甚至在与大臣讨论军国大事时，康熙皇帝也特地让弘历随侍旁听学习；康熙皇帝又让皇子胤禧教他射箭，胤禄教他火器，并经常带他去打猎，弘历不负所望，各方面均表现优秀。康熙皇帝特意召见弘历的生母，连声称她“有福之人”，并对在宫中抚养弘历的温惠皇贵妃称：“（弘历）是命贵重，福将过予。”康熙皇帝还特地要了弘历的八字，看后非常欣喜，在上面批示：“此命贵富天然，这是不用说。占得性情异常，聪明秀气出众，为人仁孝，学必文武精微。幼岁总见浮灾，并不妨碍。运交十六岁为之得运，该当身健，诸事遂心，志向更佳。命中看得妻里最贤、最能，子息极多，寿元高厚。”康熙皇帝本人是一位在位超过60年的皇帝，什么人才能“福将过予”？答案不言自明。<br><br>

如果说，康熙帝以前还有所犹豫，那么一个英武可教的孙儿自然会激发“自幼尝以英杰自许”的他的惺惺相惜，这可能促使他下了最后的决心。当时胤G已经44岁，在当时已经不算年轻。皇位继承是最重要的问题，作为一名深谋远虑的政治家，康熙皇帝自然会考虑到更长远的未来。当然弘历只是胤G得以继位的原因之一，更重要的原因还是在于其本人深获父亲的赏识。胤G幼年时由父亲亲自抚养，这在康熙皇帝的诸多皇子中非常罕见；他多次代表父亲承担祭祀大典等重要任务。同时，他的竞争对手、同母弟胤_与康熙皇帝极为痛恨的皇八子关系非常亲密，属于政治上的同盟者，他们是废太子胤i的死敌，而康熙皇帝一心想保全胤i的性命，因此他不可能将皇位传给皇八子党的成员。<br><br>

雍正合法继位<br><br>

康熙六十一年十月，刚从塞外回到京城的康熙皇帝又赴南苑行围打猎，十几天后感到身体不适，于十一月初七日回到了畅春园，并让胤G代行冬至南郊大祀。几天后，他的病情恶化，于凌晨召诸皇子与理藩院尚书隆科多至御榻前，宣布：“皇四子胤G人品贵重，深肖朕躬，必能克承大统。着继朕登基，继皇帝位。”随后胤G从南郊赶回，一天内三次请安。<br><br>

另据朝鲜使者的记载，康熙皇帝在临终前还召见过大学士马齐，还嘱咐“胤G第二子（弘历）有英雄气象，必封为太子”，且他当面要求胤G丰衣足食供养废太子、皇长子，并且要封废太子的嫡长子、他所钟爱的孙子弘皙为亲王。这些都在后来得以实现：雍正皇帝刚继位9个月，即“召诸王满汉大臣入见，面谕以建储一事，亲书谕旨，加以密封，藏于乾清宫最高处，即立弘历为皇太子之旨也”；弘皙则在康熙皇帝去世第二天封为郡王，六年后成为同辈中的第一位亲王，比已经被秘密立为皇太子的弘历晋封亲王还要早五年。<br><br>

当然，以上这些叙事，很多来源于雍正皇帝主导编纂的《圣祖仁皇帝实录》，因此未必客观，但好在康熙皇帝为孙子弘历算命的记载，来源于国立故宫博物院发现的原始档案，朝鲜使者的传言来源于《朝鲜李朝实录》，这些都不是雍正皇帝可以控制的信息，后者还得到了事实证明，因此可以有很大把握地判断，雍正皇帝的继位，正是康熙皇帝本人的意愿，是合法的，根本不需要一份官样文章的遗诏作为证据，而篡位论者却没有任何可靠的直接证据证明他们的论点。<br><br>
两个以上可靠的独立信息来源<br><br>
我们没有办法完全准确地复原历史，但起码可以给出一种更符合基本逻辑的描述，而不是只围绕着无关紧要的遗诏团团转，十多年来一次次地炒作，但辨别事实与论证能力却没有进步。试想，媒体如果在发表这一新闻前简单地搜索一下，就会知道这仅是一个重复多次、了无新意的陈旧故事；如果多采访几位清史专家，有两个以上可靠的独立信息来源，而不是只听一面之词，也不会下如此草率的结论。一般人通常没有时间与能力去辨别真假良莠，为了猎奇而一次次地复制转发，不能给这个社会提供任何有效的信息与思维能力的训练，因此新闻的核实才更加重要，因为它是陈陈相因、以讹传讹传播的源头。现代社会不患信息太少，而患信息太多，它们大多是这一类被无数次复制转发的冗余信息，而真正原创的、有价值的信息与观点却少之又少，并且常常被淹没在冗余信息的海洋中。近十多年来，“康熙遗诏”一次次被“发现”与炒作的故事正是这一现象的最好体现。<br><br>

Plot: Now You See Me <br><br>

Four gifted street magicians―J. Daniel Atlas, Henley Reeves, Jack Wilder, and Merritt McKinney―are brought together by an unknown benefactor and, one year later, perform in Las Vegas as "The Four Horsemen", sponsored by insurance magnate Arthur Tressler. For the finale, a member of the audience is invited to help them in their next trick: robbing a bank. That member in an audience is Etienne Forcier, the account holder at the CrEdit REpublicain de Paris. Forcier is apparently teleported to his bank in Paris, where he activates an air-duct that vacuums up the money and showers it onto the crowd in Las Vegas.<br><br>

Upon discovering that the money really is missing from the bank vault, FBI agent Dylan Rhodes is called to investigate the theft and is partnered with Interpol agent Alma Dray. They interrogate the Four Horsemen but release them when no explanation can be found. Dylan meets Thaddeus Bradley, an ex-magician making money by revealing the secrets behind other magicians' tricks. Thaddeus was in the audience and deduced that the Horsemen stole the money weeks before and manipulated the audience's perception of current events.<br><br>

Dylan, Dray, and Thaddeus attend the Four Horsemen's next performance in New Orleans. The group's finale involves them stealing roughly $140 million from Tressler's bank account and distributing it to the audience, composed of people whose insurance claims had been denied or reduced by Tressler's company. Dylan attempts to arrest the Four Horsemen, but they escape with help from hypnotised audience members. An infuriated Tressler hires Thaddeus to expose and humiliate the Horsemen in their next performance. Later, while researching the Four Horsemen's background, Dray learns about rumors of a secret society of magicians called "The Eye", who steal from the rich and powerful to give to the needy, and suggests to a skeptical Dylan the case might be tied to a magician named Lionel Shrike, whom Thaddeus had exposed 30 years earlier and who was so embarrassed that he undertook a dangerous underwater stunt and drowned.<br><br>

The Horsemen are located in New York, but they escape during the raid to arrest them; however, Jack is killed when he crashes a stolen car and it bursts into flames and explodes. The remaining Horsemen vow to continue and complete their final performance, stealing a safe made by the same company that made the safe Lionel Shrike died in. They perform their one last show at 5 Pointz during which they seemingly vanish into thin air, transforming into loads of money that is showered on the crowd. The money turns out to be a fake and the real money is found stashed in Thaddeus's Range Rover. Thaddeus is then assumed to be the fifth Horseman and was arrested, although he said that he was framed.<br><br>

Dylan visits Thaddeus in his cell, where Thaddeus explains that the only way the safe could have been removed was if Jack was still alive, but they would have also needed an inside man. Thaddeus realizes that Dylan is the fifth Horseman (when he disappears from the locked cell and reappearing on the outside). Dylan tells Thaddeus he wants him to spend the rest of his life in jail and leaves as Thaddeus asks why he did it. The Horsemen are now rejoined by Jack, whose death was staged. They finally meet their benefactor and are surprised to find it is Dylan. He welcomes them into "The Eye." (Wadjet, Eye of Horus)<br><br>

Later, on the Pont des Arts in France, Dray is met by Dylan (as he reveals himself to be the son of Lionel Shrike, the magician who drowned years ago). He masterminded and designed the Horsemen plot to obtain revenge on those involved: Thaddeus, for humiliating his father; the CrEdit REpublicain de Paris and Tressler's company, who refused to pay the insurance on his father's death; and the company that produced the substandard safe used in the trick that led to its failure. Dray, however, decides not to turn him in. When Dray sees the lock with a key that Dylan magically handed out in front of her eyes, he proclaimed, "One more secret to lock away". As soon as Dray locks the lock on a chain fence with all of the locks that have been locked, she throws the key into the Seine.<br><br>
